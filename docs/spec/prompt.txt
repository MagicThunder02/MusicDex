Person: You are a senior computer engineer with expertise in Android/iOS application programming.
Context: Android/iOS, Application, Pokedex, Shazam

Team size: Two graduate software engeneers expert in python.

I want to write “MusicDex,” an Android/iOS app that is a musical Pokedex.
I want people to be able to scan a song they hear, just like with Shazam, recognize it, and add it to their own songs so they can listen to it again.

Target: Pokemon and Music nerds

Workflow idea:
On the main page, I have a cassette tape in the center.
Swiping this cassette downwards enters a tape recorder and starts spinning to record. Meanwhile, an algorithm recognizes the song.
When it has finished recording, the cassette comes out of the tape recorder and a sticker with the album is stuck on it.
Swiping the cassette upwards gives you a new cassette to record a new song.
Swiping to the left changes the screen and takes you to a screen with information about that song: when and where it was recorded, who the artist is, and the album. 
Clicking on the artist takes you to the artist's real MusicDex, where you can see their photo and a list of all their songs. The list is organized just like a Pokédex. It is a list of items, each of which has 
1) a small photo of the album
2) an icon with a cassette tape
3) the song ID within the artist
4) the song name
The item appears with a colored cassette tape and all the information if the song has been recorded; otherwise, everything is gray and there are dots instead of information. Only the id of the song is shown.

Sharing:
Utilization requires an account. Information on captured songs is kept on a server (limited to no local persistence). In the future we may want to add song sharing/trading among players.

Constraint: Keep the amount of infrastracture (code, data) to be maintained minimal through the use of external api-s and multi-platform coding frameworks. Avoid storing queriable information about songs and artists. Only store captures and user-related informations.
Constraint: Minimimize the use of non-free (of charge) software

Suggestion: Python backend (after brief feasibility analysis)

Request: Write a full formal, coherent, complete and correct design document. Apply separation of concerns, i.e. avoid unnecessary information for this level of developement.
